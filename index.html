        <blockquote>
          <p>We walked through a high hallway into a <i>bright rosy-colored space,</i> fragilely bound into the house by French windows at either end.  The windows were ajar and gleaming white against the fresh grass outside that seemed to grow a little way into the house. A breeze blew through the room, blew curtains in at one end and out the other like pale flags, twisting them up toward the frosted wedding cake of the ceilingâ€”and then rippled over the wine-colored rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.</p>
